# Cardano Transactions History DB
The goal of this project is to compare the different available methods to store historical Cardano transactions data in a regular database.

## Usage
All folders in the root directory are the different possible implementations of saving transaction data to a database. Each folder contains a `README.md` file with instructions and conclusionson.
- default network is `preview` (testnet) for all implementations (can be changed by setting the `NETWORK` environment variable before running the scripts)
